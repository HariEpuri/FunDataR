### Expressions

After starting R, an R terminal window will be launched. If you bring that window into focus, you can
  start entering commands at the `>` prompt. An 'expression' is another term for a command that the
  R interpreter can process and potentially return a computed value. Pressing `<ENTER>` after a complete 
  expression results in the execution of that expression. If the expression is clearly incomplete, 
  pressing `<ENTER>` will take you to the next line, where you can continue entering your expression. 
  If the expression does not include an assignment of the resulting value to a variable (discussed 
  later in this lesson), the resulting value is typically printed out on the screen. The simplest 
  expressions are values themselves. Each value has a data type associated with it, which can be 
  determined using the `class()` function. The data type determines which operators and functions can 
  be applied to the value.

A value by itself is a complete expression. So you can enter any acceptable value at the `>` prompt,
  press `<ENTER>`, and the value will be displayed on subsequent lines in the terminal. 

Comments in R are designated by the `#` symbol. That is, anything you type after a `#` symbol will
  be ignored by the R command parser. The `#` can appear anywhere on a line. That is, it does not need 
  to be in the first column, though that is allowed as well.

### Numbers

The first data types we will look at are types used to represent numbers. There are several data
  types that are used to represent numbers. The most common is the 'numeric' type, which is
  encoded in a double-precision floating point format. The numeric type is most useful for 
  representing fractional numbers, like 1.23 as well as very large or very small magnitude numbers, 
  like `1.3e36` (1.3 x 10<sup>36</sup>) or `3.97e-24` (3.97 x 10<sup>-24</sup>). Another data type
  used for representing numbers is 'integer'. Integers are used to represent whole
  numbers (positive, negative and zero), like the counting numbers. In R these are primarily used
  for counting (no surprise) and indexing positions of particular values in more complex data 
  structures. R also has good support for representing complex numbers (numbers composed of 'real' 
  and 'imaginary' parts), but we won't describe those further in this class. For most practical 
  purposes, integers and doubles can be used interchangeably, so we will gloss over the differences 
  and conversion rules for now. Note that both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of R both use double precision
  floating point and long-integer representations of numbers. The primary difference between these
  versions is the size of pointers, which has implications for the maximum size of data structures
  that can be generated by the two versions, but does not affect the representations of individual 
  numbers.

An integer value is composed solely of an optional sign and digits. It should be followed by 
  `L` (for 'long integer') to ensure R understands an integer is intended. A numeric value can be composed 
  of digits, an optional sign, an optional single decimal place, and either `E` or `e` followed by
  an positive or negative integer exponent (see above for some examples):

```
2                  ## a super-simple numeric value
2L                 ## the almost equally simple integer equivalent
```

A function is a bit of computer code that can be called by name, given an argument (in parentheses
  following the function's name), and returns a value and/or performs some operations. One simple 
  function is `class()`, which tells you the data type of its argument. To find out the details of
  what a function does, you can precede the function name (unquoted) with a `?`, or call the 
  `help()` function with the function name (unquoted) as argument:

```
class(2)                ## looks like an integer, but ...
class(2L)
?class
help(class)
```

An expression can be made by combining operators (like the `+` below) with values (like the numeric
  values `2` and `3` below). You can find out more about an operator by placing the operator in
  single or double quotes and preceding it with a `?`, or by calling the `help()` function:

```
2 + 3                   ## a complete expression with two values and one operator (`+`)
class(2 + 3)            ## the class of the result of the operation
2L + 3L                 ## integer math
class(2L + 3L)          ## result is integer too
2L + 3                  ## mixing integer and numeric: integer gets converted to numeric
class(2L + 3)
?"+"
help('+')
?"Syntax"               ## where to find operators and precedence
??precedence            ## in case you forget, ?? does a full-text search of help library
2 / 3                   ## divide
2 * 3                   ## multiply
2 - 3                   ## subtract
2 ^ 3                   ## power (coefficient and exponent need not be positive nor integer)
```

If you hate to memorize precedence tables (I do) or want to change the order of operations, you
  can enclose parts of the expression in parentheses (per the usual mathematical conventions)
  to ensure execution in the order you intend:

```
2 + 3 / 5
(2 + 3) / 5
3 ^ (1 / 2)
(3 ^ (1 / 2)) ^ 2
```

### Check your understanding:

1) what is the third-root of 5

2) what is the sum of 500,726 and 324,781, divided by 67?

3) what is 3.14 to the 3.14 power?

### Logicals:

Certain operators (and functions) which take numbers as arguments, can return logical
  values (a data type that can only represent the two values 'TRUE' and 'FALSE'). The 
  equality operators are a good example:

```
2 < 3                   ## is 2 less than 3?
2 >= 3                  ## is 2 greater than or equal to 3?
2 == 3                  ## is 2 equal to 3?
2 == 2                  ## is 2 equal to 2?
2 != 3                  ## is 2 not equal to 3?
?"<"                    ## what does the '<' operator do?
class(2 < 3)            ## what data type is returned by the '<' operator?
```

Logical values are represented by the unquoted (case-sensitive) tokens `TRUE`, `T`, 
  `FALSE`, and `F`:

```
TRUE                    ## ok
True                    ## oops: case sensitive
true                    ## oops: case sensitive
T                       ## ok
t                       ## oops: case sensitive + the name of the matrix transposition function
TR                      ## oops, only T or TRUE
class(T)
FALSE                   ## ok
FA                      ## oops, only F or FALSE
F                       ## ok
```

Logical values can be combined using the operators `&&` (and) as well as `||` (or).

They can also be combined with the function `xor()` (exclusive or), and negated with the
unary (only takes one argument) operator `!`:

```
TRUE && TRUE            ## what is (T and T)?
TRUE && FALSE           ## what is (T and F)?
TRUE || TRUE            ## what is (T or T)?  this is the one that differs from 'xor()'!!!
TRUE || FALSE           ## what is (T or F)?
FALSE || FALSE          ## what is (F or F)?
xor(TRUE, FALSE)        ## what is (T xor F)?
xor(TRUE, TRUE)         ## what is (T xor T)? this is the one that differs from '&&'!!!
xor(FALSE, FALSE)       ## what is (F xor F)?
!T                      ## not TRUE
!F                      ## not FALSE
```

### Characters:

Although R is primarily a programming language for crunching numbers, we still often need
  to represent 'strings' that is a series of characters, which can include not only digits,
  signs, and decimal places, but any letters, numbers, punctuation, etc. This job is 
  handled by the 'character' data type in R. Character values are used as labels for
  group membership (e.g. treated vs. untreated; allele status; gender; etc) when 
  analyzing categorical data. The 'character' type is also used to specify information
  such as file paths, software package information, usage hints, error messages, etc.
  Character values are set apart by being enclosed in single or double quotes. In R,
  single and double quotes are equivalent. The norm is to use double quotes, unless you 
  need to embed a double quote in a string, in which case enclose the entire string
  in single quotes.

```
"abc de"                        ## 1x and 2x equivalent; 2x 'preferred'
class("abc de")
''                              ## use 2x to embed 1x and vice-versa
class('')                       ## an empty string in quotes is still of type character

nchar('')                       ## how many characters long (\0 not counted)
nchar('abc de')
substr('abc de', 2, 4)          ## substring: 2d to 4th character, inclusive

tolower('AbCdE123_')            ## convert to lower-case
toupper('AbCdE123_')            ## convert to upper-case

sub('b', 'd', 'ab cba')         ## substitute first instance of 'b' w/ 'd'; regex-friendly
gsub('b', 'd', 'ab cba')        ## substitute all instances of 'b' w/ 'd'; regex-friendly
 
grepl('bc', 'abcba')            ## does second argument contain first as substring? regex-friendly
grepl('yx', 'abcba')            ## does second argument contain first as substring? regex-friendly
```
