### Comparing population proportions

intro here

brief description of dataset

```
## prep our data for analysis:
rm(list=ls())

?USArrests                          ## find out about a built-in dataset
dat <- USArrests                    ## arrests per 100,000 in 1973; by state
class(dat)                          ## data frame
dim(dat)                            ## one row per state
summary(dat)
head(dat)
tail(dat)

dat <- dat * 10                      ## convert to whole numbers; now arrests per 10,000

## total up arrests:
dat$Total <- apply(dat[, c(1, 2, 4)], 1, sum)
summary(dat)
head(dat)
tail(dat)

## set up comparison of Vermont to New York:
x <- dat[c('Vermont', 'New York'), c('Murder', 'Total')]
x
x$Murder
x$Total

```

Now we can do the actual test (easy part):

```
## did arrest rates (proportion per 10,000 or 1e4) differ?
(rslt <- prop.test(x=x$Total, n=c(1e4, 1e4)))
rslt$conf.int                     ## confidence interval on difference in proportion

## did murders as a proportion of arrests differ?
(rslt <- prop.test(x=x$Murder, n=x$Total))
rslt$conf.int                     ## confidence interval on difference in proportion

```

Extend the proportion test to more than 2 groups:

```
x <- dat[c('Vermont', 'New York', 'California'), c('Murder', 'Total')]
x
x$Murder
x$Total

## did arrest rates (proportion per 10,000 or 1e4) differ AMONG ANY OF THE THREE?
(rslt <- prop.test(x=x$Total, n=c(1e4, 1e4, 1e4)))
str(rslt)                         ## no confidence interval when >2 groups

## did murders as a proportion of arrests differ AMONG ANY OF THE THREE?
(rslt <- prop.test(x=x$Murder, x$Total))
str(rslt)                         ## no confidence interval when >2 groups

```

Mention the chisq.test() for contingency tables and goodness-of-fit. Conceptual
  difference from prop.test(). In R, prop.test() calls chisq.test() then prints
  the results differently.

Binomial test not right for >1 groups. Can use Fisher's Exact Test `fisher.test()`
  to do non-parametric test. Some object to an implicit assumption of the test
  that marginal totals are fixed. Creates some issues defining the population
  the estimates apply to. Calculation of an exact p-value can  become computationally 
  very costly for more than two groups.

### Comparing two population means

intro here; h0 is difference in group means, `h0: (m1 - m2) == 0`. ci is on 
  the difference in group means, so if 95% CI does not include 0, h0 will be 
  rejected w/ p < 0.05. One-sided h0s: `(m1 - m2) >= 0` or `(m1 - m2) <= 0`

Brief description of dataset.

```
## prep our data for analysis:

rm(list=ls())

dat <- mtcars
dat
table(dat$cyl)

(x <- dat$mpg[dat$cyl == 4])
(y <- dat$mpg[dat$cyl == 8])

## two-sided test: confidence interval is on difference in group means;
##   default version: upaired, Welch's (no assumption of group variances
##   being equal). p-value is of h0: difference between group means is zero.

(rslt <- t.test(x=x, y=y))

## one-sided test: h0: difference is less than or equal to zero:
(rslt <- t.test(x=x, y=y, alternative='greater'))

## test assuming both groups have same variance:
(rslt <- t.test(x=x, y=y, var.equal=T))

(rslt <- t.test(x=x, y=y, var.equal=T, alternative='greater'))

class(rslt)                       ## h(ypothesis)test
is.list(rslt)                     ## why we can use '$' to index elements
names(rslt)                       ## same old same old
attributes(rslt)

```

A note on picking tests before examining the data.

Background on repeated measures. Trade-off between degrees of freedom and effect size.

```
## set up data:
rm(list=ls())

dat <- sleep
dat
table(dat$group)

(x <- dat$extra[dat$group == 1])
(y <- dat$extra[dat$group == 2])

## do an unpaired test for comparison:

rslt1 <- t.test(x=x, y=y)

## conduct the paired test:

rslt2 <- t.test(x=x, y=y, paired=T)

## can do one-sided as well:

rslt3 <- t.test(x=x, y=y, paired=T, alternative='less')

c(p1=rslt1$p.value, p2=rslt2$p.value, p3=rslt3$p.value)
cbind(ci1=rslt1$conf.int, ci2=rslt2$conf.int, ci3=rslt3$conf.int)
